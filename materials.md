On this page I will be posting and updating lecture materials, exercises and materials for the current year brushup.

## Shell (Command Line Interfaces)
Have a look at the shell exercises [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/k0drcYeU). 

The repo contains 3 folders corresponding to different assignments, one handout "handout_bash.html", and one ".gitignore" file (it makes git to omit several files from consideration at all). In the handout you can find a lot of information not only about Bourne again Shell, but also about Git and GitHub, and Servers.

_Recommended literature:_  "Classic Shell Scripting" by Arnold Robbins and Nelson H. F. Beebe.

## Python materials

### Exercises
\[0\] [Hello World](./python/python-hello-world.md); \[1\] [Functions](https://classroom.github.com/a/gktpSa0b); \[2\] [Conditionals](https://classroom.github.com/a/8z5oJ3NH); \[3\] [Loops](https://classroom.github.com/a/wNjETpHQ); \[4\] [Dictionaries](https://classroom.github.com/a/XLLvn9Bf); \[5\] [Classes](https://classroom.github.com/a/i68vlRpz); \[6\] [JSON](https://classroom.github.com/a/a-NMDKjN).

Extra materials on Pandas: [Intro](https://classroom.github.com/a/njB-uPr9); [Grouping](https://classroom.github.com/a/7-ROyzM8); [Project](https://classroom.github.com/a/sQeld2pZ). I recommend you to complete these assignments since it will help you to get comfortable with Pandas. There are also some notebooks with tutorial materials for pandas. I will do a coding review for these assignments upon requests.

## R materials
All the main materials are incorporated into a GitHub Classroom assignment: ["R: Tutorial"](https://classroom.github.com/a/ktRHGKzO). 

You can find the in-class handouts there together with some practical exercises. For more information, please read the README file in the repo.

In the corresponding repository, you can also find Rextra folder which contains some extra materials on linear models in R.
