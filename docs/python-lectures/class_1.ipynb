    "As data scientists, you will be working with -- not surprisingly -- data. A concept of variable in Python embodies what we may mean while saying the word \"data\". A variable has a *name* and points to an associated *memory cell* where some *value* is stored. So, to define a variable, we just need to assign a value (more generally -- an expression) to a chosen name by using a binary operator `=`. That is, the assignment construction looks as `name = expression`. The name of a variable is also called an *identifier*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a problem of computing an area of a rectangle with sides 3 and 5. First, let's define the original data in the code cell bellow. Try to run the cell: 1. select it with your mouse or by using the arrows, 2. tap on a play button or use `control (ctrl) + enter` combination, note that the hotkey may be different for the interface you are trying to run this notebook in. Another useful combination is `shift + enter` which selects the next cell after running the previous one. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might be asked to choose a Python interpreter depending on the interface you are running this script in. If there is a \"default\" / \"global\" version, choose one of those, otherwise choose the latest one.

Also, a variable name cannot start with a number.  \n",

For example, `car_speed = 50`. From this example, you can also see that it can be hard to understand a code without any additional comments. So you can comment your code using hash character `#`, like this:\n",

    "`car_speed = 50  # note that everywhere in the program speed is measured in km/h`. \n",
